## Abstract

Mutational activation of the *KRAS* oncogene promotes initiation and/or progression of cancer in a variety of tissues.
Though the mutant variants seemingly exert similar biological outputs, the biochemical properties and downstream signaling  of each is distinct and highly context-dependent.
As such, the genetic interactions associated with *KRAS* mutants are likely to vary according to the specific allele and the tissue-of-origin of the cancer.
To explore this concept, 13,492 samples were collated from four tumor types with the highest frequency of mutation in *KRAS*: colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, multiple myeloma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Each cancer had a distinct spectrum of *KRAS* activating mutations that could not be predicted by the prevalence of known mutagenic mechanisms.
Moreover, each allele was associated with a distinct comutation network that was also tissue-specific.
Analyzing genetic dependencies highlighted cellular functions and individual genes that were or were not required for tumors with specific *KRAS* alleles.
Overall, this analysis demonstrates that the *KRAS* alleles have distinct genetic interactions likely linked to their biological differences that can be further investigated as therapeutic targets.
